# Python Parser Project

## Overview
This project involves the creation of a parser for a subset of the Python programming language. Using ANTLR (ANother Tool for Language Recognition), we have developed a grammar that can parse and interpret basic Python syntax including conditional statements, loops, and basic arithmetic operations. The parser is designed to be a foundational tool for further language processing and understanding tasks.
